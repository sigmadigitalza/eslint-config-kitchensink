# Eslint Config Kitchensink
an extensive, highly opinionated general, purpose `eslint` config that can be included independently. (NB: this is already included via our configs module).

## This includes:
* Airbnb
* Prettier
* Flow & Flow-errors
* React / JSX
* Jest

This config uses the `babel-loader` and sets a number of custom warnings, configured as per our particular preferences, and experience on recent projects.
